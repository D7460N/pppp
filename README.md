# Protecting The Elderly From Scammers

### Phone Privacy Plan (PPP)

This document explains how to impliment a simple, safe, and cost-effective system to protect elderly from scammers, spam callers, and financial predators.  
It uses a private “front-end” phone number to shield the real phone number.

---

# WHY THIS IS NECESSARY

Elderly individuals are at extremely high risk for:
- Scam calls  
- Fake bank calls  
- Fraud attempts  
- Social engineering (“Grandparent Scam”)  
- Identity theft  
- Pressure tactics from bad actors  

If the real phone number is already leaked online or in old data breaches, scammers can easily target the individual by:
- Auto-dialing  
- Spoofing banks or government offices  
- Pretending to be family  
- Using personal details gathered from the internet

This plan stops that.

## SUMMARY

Create a **new, safe phone number** that outsiders call.  
This is done using **VoIP call-forwarding**, which works like a shield.

Important:
- The elderly person **keeps their real phone number**  
- But **nobody outside the family ever sees it again**  
- All public calls go through a protected number first  
- Scammers cannot reach the real number  

This prevents:
- Identity exposure  
- Location leaks  
- Caller-ID tracing  
- SIM-swap attacks  
- Manipulative scam calls reaching the real line

## HOW THE PROTECTED NUMBER WORKS

Incoming call path:

Caller → Protected Number → Forwards → Real Phone

Benefits:
- The real phone number remains private  
- Scammers cannot directly attack the phone  
- The protected number can be changed at any time  
- If a number gets compromised, a new one can replace it instantly  
- The elderly person experiences **no change at all**. Their phone rings normally.

There is **no app** needed.  
No new device.  
No learning curve.

## STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### 1. Acquire a Protected Phone Number
Use a reputable VoIP provider (example: VoIP.ms).  
Choose a number in the same area code as the elderly person for familiarity.

### 2. Enable Call Forwarding
Set the protected number to **forward all calls** to the real phone number.

This stops scammers from ever seeing the real number.

### 3. Disable Caller Name (CNAM) Publishing
This prevents the number from being listed in public directories.

### 4. Set a Neutral Voicemail Greeting
Use the VoIP number’s voicemail, not the cell carrier’s voicemail.

Recommended greeting:
> “You’ve reached the voicemail. Please leave a message.”

No names, no personal information.

### 5. Give Out ONLY the Protected Number
Family, doctors, businesses, and services should use the protected number.

The real number becomes “internal only.”

### 6. Silence Unknown Callers on the Real Phone
If a scammer somehow gets through, the device will not ring.

iPhone:  
**Settings → Phone → Silence Unknown Callers: ON**

Android:  
**Settings → Spam & Call Screen → Filter Spam: ON**

### 7. Use the Protected Number for All New Accounts
Whenever a company, website, or service asks for a phone:
- Use the protected number  
- Never use the real cellphone number  

This greatly reduces future leak risks.

## OPTIONAL FAMILY PROTECTIONS

### Enable Verizon (or carrier) Fraud & SIM Protection
Ask the carrier to:
- Add an account PIN  
- Enable SIM swap protection  
- Add a “freeze” to prevent unauthorized changes

### Set Up Call Filtering
Use the carrier’s spam filter on High.

### Consider a VPN for Internet Privacy
(Not required for phone protection, but helps with device protection.)

---

## WHAT TO DO IF THE OLD NUMBER IS ALREADY ON THE DARK WEB

You cannot delete a leaked number,
but you can **neutralize** it by:
- No longer giving it out  
- Shielding it behind the protected number  
- Letting spam accumulate harmlessly  
- Avoiding any meaningful use of the real number  
- Using the protected number for everything public  

Over time, scammers stop reaching the real phone.

## MAINTENANCE (VERY SIMPLE)
