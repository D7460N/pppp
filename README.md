# Protecting The Vulnerable From Scammers

## Phone Privacy Protection Plan (PPPP)

PURPOSE : :  
This document is meant to raise awareness about how scammers, spam callers, and financial predators target vulnerable individuals—circling them like vultures—and to explain how to implement a simple, safe, and cost-effective Phone Privacy Protection Plan (PPPP).

GOAL : :  
The goal is to reduce the “attack surface” that bad actors exploit to deceive, manipulate, and financially victimize vulnerable people.

### STEP 01 : :

**Acquire a Protected VoIP Phone Number** from a reputable VoIP provider (example: VoIP.ms).

- This private, front-end phone number shields the vulnerable person’s real phone number.
- All outside callers interact with this "shield" number, not the individual’s true line.
- Choose a number in the same area code as the elderly person for familiarity.
- There is **no app** needed
- No new device
- No new learning curve

### STEP 02 : :

**Enable VOIP Call Forwarding** on the new "shield" number to **forward all calls** to the real phone number.

- This stops scammers from ever seeing the real number
- The person at risk **keeps their real phone number**
- **Nobody outside the family ever sees it again**
- All public calls go through the "shield" number first
- Scammers cannot reach the real number
- The "shield" number can be changed at any time
- The real phone number remains private
- Scammers cannot directly attack the phone
- If a number gets compromised, a new one can replace it instantly  
- The person experiences **no change at all**. Their phone rings normally.

### STEP 03 : :

**Disable Caller Name (CNAM) Publishing** to prevent the "shield" number from being listed in public directories.

### STEP 04 : :

**Set a Neutral Voicemail Greeting** by using the VoIP number’s voicemail, not the cell carrier’s voicemail. Example: “You’ve reached the voicemail. Please leave a message.” No names, no personal information.

### STEP 05 : :

**Give Out ONLY the Protected Number**

- Family, doctors, businesses, and services should use the protected number.
- The real number becomes “internal only.”

### STEP 06 : :

**Silence Unknown Callers** on the Real Phone. If a scammer somehow gets through, the device will not ring.

- iPhone:  
**Settings > Phone > Silence Unknown Callers: ON**
- Android:  
**Settings → Spam & Call Screen → Filter Spam: ON**

### STEP 07 : :

**Use the "Shield" Number for All New Accounts** 

Whenever a company, website, or service asks for a phone:
- Use the "shield" number  
- Never use the real cellphone number
- This greatly reduces future leak risks.

## OPTIONAL FAMILY PROTECTIONS

- Enable (carrier) Fraud & SIM Protection
- Set Up Call Filtering
- Use the carrier’s spam filter on High.
- Ask the carrier to:
 - Add an account PIN  
 - Enable SIM swap protection  
 - Add a “freeze” to prevent unauthorized changes

### Consider a VPN for Internet Privacy
(Not required for phone protection, but helps with device protection.)

## This prevents : :
- Identity exposure  
- Location leaks  
- Caller-ID tracing  
- SIM-swap attacks  
- Manipulative scam calls reaching the real line






---

## WHY THIS IS NECESSARY

Vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly, are at extremely high risk for:
- Scam calls
- Fake bank calls
- Fraud attempts
- Social engineering (“Grandparent Scam”)
- Identity theft
- Pressure tactics from bad actors

If the real phone number is already leaked online or in old data breaches, scammers can easily target the individual by:
- Auto-dialing  
- Spoofing banks or government offices  
- Pretending to be family  
- Using personal details gathered from the internet

This plan may help mitigate, minimize, and even stop that all together.

- Enable SIM swap protection  
- Add a “freeze” to prevent unauthorized changes

### Set Up Call Filtering

### Consider a VPN for Internet Privacy
(Not required for phone protection, but helps with device protection.)

## STEP-BY-STEP SETUP

### 1. Acquire a Protected Phone Number
Use a reputable VoIP provider (example: VoIP.ms).  
Choose a number in the same area code as the elderly person for familiarity.

### 2. Enable Call Forwarding
Set the protected number to **forward all calls** to the real phone number.

This stops scammers from ever seeing the real number.

### 3. Disable Caller Name (CNAM) Publishing
This prevents the number from being listed in public directories.

### 4. Set a Neutral Voicemail Greeting
Use the VoIP number’s voicemail, not the cell carrier’s voicemail.

Recommended greeting:
> “You’ve reached the voicemail. Please leave a message.”

No names, no personal information.

### 5. Give Out ONLY the Protected Number
Family, doctors, businesses, and services should use the protected number.

The real number becomes “internal only.”

### 6. Silence Unknown Callers on the Real Phone
If a scammer somehow gets through, the device will not ring.

iPhone:  
**Settings → Phone → Silence Unknown Callers: ON**

Android:  
**Settings → Spam & Call Screen → Filter Spam: ON**

### 7. Use the Protected Number for All New Accounts
Whenever a company, website, or service asks for a phone:
- Use the protected number  
- Never use the real cellphone number  

This greatly reduces future leak risks.

## WHAT TO DO IF THE OLD NUMBER IS ALREADY ON THE DARK WEB

You cannot delete a leaked number,
but you can **neutralize** it by:
- No longer giving it out  
- Shielding it behind the protected number  
- Letting spam accumulate harmlessly  
- Avoiding any meaningful use of the real number  
- Using the protected number for everything public  

Over time, scammers stop reaching the real phone.
